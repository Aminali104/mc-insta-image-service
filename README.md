# Image Upload Service

This repository contains a Serverless-based application that allows users to upload images, list images, view/download images, and delete images. The service uses **AWS S3** for image storage, **AWS DynamoDB** for metadata storage, and **AWS Lambda** for function execution. It also uses **LocalStack** for local emulation of AWS services.
